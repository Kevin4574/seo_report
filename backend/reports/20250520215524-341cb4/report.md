## 8. LLM 建议

Improve the content score by increasing the text-to-HTML ratio and ensuring the content is more comprehensive and keyword-rich.

Add alt attributes to the 57 images currently missing them to enhance accessibility and image SEO.

Enhance technical SEO by addressing the low performance score, possibly through optimizing page speed and ensuring mobile responsiveness.

Increase the authority score by building more high-quality backlinks and improving social media integration and engagement.

Consider reducing the number of H3 tags (currently 35) to improve content hierarchy and readability.
